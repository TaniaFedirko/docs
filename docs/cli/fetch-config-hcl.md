# Fetch config.hcl

`config.hcl` is the main (and only) file need for `cloudquery` to perform a fetch. As the suffix suggests, it uses the [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) language (See [why](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl)).

In most cases this files can be generated by `cloudquery init [provider_name]` and then you can just tweak the configuration if needed.

## cloudquery block

`cloudquery` block must be specified exactly once per `config.hcl`. This is usually 

```hcl
// Configuration AutoGenerated by CloudQuery CLI
cloudquery {
  plugin_directory = "./cq/providers"
  policy_directory = "./cq/policies"

  provider "aws" {
    source  = ""
    version = "latest"
  }

  connection {
    dsn = "host=localhost user=postgres password=pass database=postgres port=5432"
  }
}
```

#### Arguments:

* plugin_directory - directory where cloudquery will download provider plugins.
* policy_directory - directory where cloudquery will download policies

### provider block

This block must be specified one or more times. Specifing which providers and which versions you want to use. All official and approved community providers are listed on [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io) with their respective version and documentation.

`cloudquery fetch` command will download all the providers with their respective version to `plugin_directory`. Once they are downloaded, cloudquery will verify them and execute them to ETL the configuration and metadata each provider supports.

#### connection block

connection block specifies to which database you should connect via `dsn` argument.

## provider block

Provider block must be specified one or more times and they should be first specified in the `cloudquery` block.

Each provider has two blocks 

* `configuration` - The arguments are different from provider to provider and their documentation can be found in [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io)
* `resources` - all resources that this providers supports and can fetch configuration and meta-data from them.


:::tip
You can have multiple provider of the same type specified here. For example if you want to fetch data from different accounts (and you don't have a cross account access for some reason).
